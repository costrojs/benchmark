# Benchmark Svelte

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Available Scripts

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Start a development server.

### `npm run build`

Build code for production.

### `npm run preview`

Preview the built app, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
